# election-analysis

  This week I was brought into asiset Tom and Seth with a program using python and it to assist with a audit of Colorado Board of Elections on a recent local congressional election.
  
  list of objetives 
•	calculate the total number votes from  databases 
•	provide a breakdown of the candidates, votes per county as well as provide a percentage of the total number of votes in each county  
•	tell which county had the largest number of votes 
•	give a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentages eared by each candidate 
•	and lastly which candidate won and the vote count and the percentages of the total votes 

Resources 

I will be using election_results.csv as my database this will be where I pull the voting information from and i will be using python 3.7.9 for this project, as well as Visual Studio Code.

After coding the whole audit the analysis showed the following results 
•	the number of votes was 369,711

The three candidates and their percentages (Total votes)
•	Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
•	Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
•	Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The winner was Diana DeGette 

This week I used python to sort a large amount of data for an a election some things I needed for this project was python 3.7, jupyter notebook, VS code, as well as a interpreter, and lastly a data set on a csv file and I wrote the results on a txt file. Coding this was difficult at times, because I am so very new to coding, and ran into a lot of syntax errors and was not sure how to deal with them all, but after a lot of looking up right solutions and working with my T.A. over all the task was accomplish. I would still like to work on this project more in the future, because the more I think about this they will be pleased with the results. and i hope to use this code in the future to do other election audits with it, we could add state or a different region, as well for other things other then goverment elections they could be used in shows and in other ways aswell with a slite change in the variables and use this code could be used across the world.

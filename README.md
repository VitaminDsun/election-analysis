# election-analysis

  This week I was brought into asset Tom a Seth with a program using python and it to assist with a audit of Colorado Board of Elections on a recent local congressional election.
  
•	calculate the total number votes from  databases 
•	provide a breakdown of the candidates, votes per county as well as provide a percentage of the total number of votes in each county  
•	tell which county had the largest number of votes 
•	give a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentages eared by each candidate 
•	and lastly which candidate won and the vote count and the percentages of the total votes 

#Resources 
I will be using election_results.csv as my database this will be where I pull the voting information form and i will be using python 3.7.9 for this project, as well as Visual Studio Code.

After coding the whole audit the analysis showed the following results 
•	the number of votes was 369,711
•	the three candidates and their percentages (Total votes)

•	Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
•	Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
•	Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
• The winner was Diana DeGette 

This week using python to sort a large amount of date for an a election some things need for this project was python, as well as a interpreter I also worked with csv files and also had the results written on a txt file coding this was difficult at time because I am so very net to coding, and rand in to a lot of syntax errors and was not sure how to deal with them all over all the task was accomplish I still need to work on this more I think they will be pleased with the results and hope to use this code in the future to do other election audit with it we could add state or a different region in the variables and use this code for many other elections across the world
